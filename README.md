# May The Force Be With You

"Without the midi-chlorians, life could not exist, and we would have no knowledge of the Force. They continually speak to us, telling us the will of the Force. When you learn to quiet your mind, you'll hear them speaking to you."
â€•Qui-Gon Jinn, to Anakin Skywalker[src]
